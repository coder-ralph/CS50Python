# Quiz Game by Ralph

#### Description:

The Quiz Game is a simple Python program that allows users to participate in a multiple-choice quiz. The game prompts the user to enter their name before starting the quiz. After answering a series of questions, the program calculates the user's score and displays the result.

## Project Structure

- `project.py`: Contains the main code for running the quiz game.
- `test_project.py`: Includes unit tests for the `run_quiz()` function using the `pytest` framework.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the following command to start the quiz game:

    ```
    python project.py

    ```

5. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter your name and answer the quiz questions.
6. Once you have answered all the questions, the program will display your name and score.

## Testing

The project includes unit tests to ensure the correctness of the `run_quiz()` function. To run the tests, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory.
2. Run the following command:

    ```
    python test_project.py

    ```

3. The tests will be executed, and the results will be displayed in the terminal.

## Future Enhancements

- Allow customization of the quiz questions by reading them from an external file.
- Implement a timer to limit the time for answering each question.
- Add a high score feature to keep track of the best scores achieved.
